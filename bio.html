			<h3>A brief history of Zach</h3>
			<p>I grew up in the small town of Putnam Valley NY, where I went to high school. This is my second year in the Tufts School of Engineering. Here I am a member of Tufts Electric Racing, where I design and troubleshoot electrical systems on an all electric FSAE car. I study Electrical Engineering.
