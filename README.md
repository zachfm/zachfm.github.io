#The Homepage of Zachary Faber Manning

This website is a project to create a public profile and resume online.
The site consists of:
	-An html file for 3 pages (bio, home, and resume) verified with the w3c
html verification tool
	-A mobile-friendly stylesheet shared by all pages, verified with the
w3c css verification tool.
	-This readme
	-A picture for the bio page

All assignment requirements for COMP20 have been met.
Troubleshooting for the css was helped in part from discussions with
Tom Frikker.
The website took approximately 5 hours to build.
